# Week 1: the Concept
“Step 1 is something you do in your head. Now fantasy/swords &
sorcery games need not have any fixed basis for the assumptions
made by its referee (my own doesn't) except those which embrace the
whole of fantasy. This sort of campaign can mix any and all of the
various bases which will be mentioned below - and then some.

Regardless for what setting you opt, keep it secret from your players,
or else they can study your sources and become immediately too
knowledgable, thus removing the charm of uncertainty. Settings based
upon the limits (if one can speak of fantasy limits) can be very
interesting in themselves providing the scope of the setting will allow
the players relative free-reign to their imaginations.” – EGG
