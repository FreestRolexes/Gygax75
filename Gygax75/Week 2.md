# Week 2: Surrounding Area
_Map the land around the dungeon and town.__

Gygax suggests “sitting down with a large piece of hex ruled paper
and drawing a large scale map. A map with a scale of 1 hex = 1 mile
… will be about right for player operations such as exploring,
camping, adventuring, and eventually building their strongholds. Even
such small things as a witch's hut and side entrances to the dungeon
can be shown on the map. The central features of the map must be the
major town and the dungeon entrance.” – EGG

## Questions / Notes
-   JJH: Do we want hexcrawls?  Alternatives:

	  - ["blob-crawls"](https://deadtreenoshelter.blogspot.com/2020/05/blob-crawl.html)
	  - I have _tons_ of articles describing hex maps
  - JJH: 1 mile hexes seem nuts - standard is 5 or 6 miles for overland travel
  - JJH: I have _Lots_ of opinions on random encounter tables... but mostly I think we should definitely have one
