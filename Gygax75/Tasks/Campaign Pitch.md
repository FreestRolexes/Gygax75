# Pitches
- 1) There was a revolution against the reclusive, decadent [[ruling class]] that ended N years ago. The revolutionaries won and have up-ended life in this region. 
- 2) [[Revolutionary Armies]] are quarreling to assume control, classes close to the [[ruling class]] are being persecuted, safety/protection of rural regions has been neglected, and sacred sites are left unguarded.
	- [[1st adventure]] and [[dungeon]] are one of these sites

## Guidelines
- 3 - 7 _well-crafted_ bullet points that will "sell" the world.
- Concise/focused - a few sentences each
- Give players an idea of what they can (or cannot) expect to find in the setting

## Scratchpad
- One bullet should be about magic
- One bullet should be about religion
	- Monotheist?  Polytheist?
	- Which sides (ruling class and revolutionaries) Probably want something about magic and religion of the world (2 bullets)
