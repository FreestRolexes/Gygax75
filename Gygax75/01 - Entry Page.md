# Gygax 75 

An attempt to *stop*, collaborate, and listen... to the [Gygax75 "Challenge"](https://rayotus.itch.io/gygax75?_sm_nck=1)!

We'll follow the weekly prompts to:
• Establish a setting concept
• Develop the surrounding area
• Create 1-3 levels of a dungeon
• Detail a sizable, nearby town
• Invent some campaign secrets

## Guidance
- The weekly calendar should be followed.  If you fall behind, mark what you didn't get to and move on.  Don't go back to perfect, keep moving forward.

## Weeks
- [[Week 1]]
- [[Week 2]]
- [[Week 3]]
- [[Week 4]]

## Tools
